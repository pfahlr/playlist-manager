title: OpenAPI lints to zero (license, servers, operationId, 4xx, path ambiguity)
branch: codex/04b_openapi_warning_silencer
overview: >
  Clean up openapi.yaml: add info.license, use variable server for localhost,
  add operationId to all ops, add at least one 4xx per op, and rename follow route
  to /artists/{mbid}/follow to eliminate ambiguity with /artists/{mbid}/relations.
acceptance:
  - redocly lint openapi.yaml has 0 warnings for:
    info-license, no-server-example.com, operation-operationId, operation-4xx-response, no-ambiguous-paths
  - openapi-typescript runs clean (no type regressions)
artifacts_to_touch:
  - openapi.yaml
  - .redocly.yaml (optional, if needed keep extends: recommended)
steps:
  - Add MIT license block to info
  - Replace servers with: prod placeholder + http://{host}:{port}/api/v1
  - Assign operationId to every operation, add 400/404 responses
  - Change follow endpoints to /artists/{mbid}/follow (POST/DELETE)
