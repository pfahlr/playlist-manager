  - e-commerce

description: |
  Implement an affiliate monetization system that generates revenue through contextual
  recommendations for vinyl records, concert tickets, and artist merchandise. This
  allows the app to remain FREE while generating revenue without ads, and provides
  genuine value to users by helping them support artists directly.

problem: |
  The app needs revenue to sustain free service, but:
  - Ads are intrusive and reduce user experience
  - Subscriptions create barrier to entry
  - Need monetization that aligns with user interests
  - Want to remain neutral regarding streaming platforms

  Users already spend money on music (vinyl, concerts, merch), so contextual
  affiliate recommendations are natural and valuable.

solution: |
  Build an affiliate system that:
  1. Shows vinyl purchase options when viewing albums
  2. Displays upcoming tour dates with ticket purchase links
  3. Recommends artist merchandise contextually
  4. Uses affiliate links to earn commission
  5. Tracks conversions and revenue
  6. Remains tasteful and non-intrusive
  7. Prioritizes user experience over aggressive selling

technical_requirements:
  backend:
    - Integrate Discogs API for vinyl availability and pricing
    - Integrate Bandsintown API for tour dates
    - Integrate ticketing platforms (Ticketmaster, StubHub, SeeTickets)
    - Integrate merch platforms (Merchbar, artist direct stores)
    - Create affiliate link generation service
    - Add click tracking and conversion attribution

      - GET /artists/{id}/merchandise
      - POST /affiliate/click (tracking)
      - POST /affiliate/conversion (tracking)

monetization_impact: |
  Projected revenue (conservative estimates):
  - 100K MAU (monthly active users)
  - 5% click-through rate = 5K clicks/month
  - 2% conversion rate = 100 conversions/month
  - $50 average order value
  - 10% average commission
  - = $500/month revenue

  At scale (1M MAU):
  - $5,000/month = $60K/year

  With optimization:
  - 10% CTR, 5% conversion
  - = $25K/month = $300K/year

  Key drivers:
  - More engaged users = higher CTR
  - Better recommendations = higher conversion
  - Multiple revenue streams (vinyl + tickets + merch + ads)
  - Revenue compounds as user base grows

notes: |
  - Start with vinyl (easiest to implement and track)
  - Add tours/tickets next (time-sensitive, higher engagement)
  - Add merch last (most complex, varies by artist)
  - Consider creating own merch for the app (additional revenue)
  - Partner with indie record labels for better commission rates
  - Implement "Fair Trade Music" badge system (which services pay artists best)
  - Consider donation option to artists directly (take small fee)
  - Add "support local record stores" feature (affiliate with local shops)
  - Gamification: badges for supporting X artists or buying Y vinyl
  - Newsletter with curated vinyl deals (additional touchpoint)
  - "Wishlist" feature for users to save vinyl they want
  - Price drop alerts for wishlisted items
  - Consider record club subscription (curated vinyl delivered monthly)
