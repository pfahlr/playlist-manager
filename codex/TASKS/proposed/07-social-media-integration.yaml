title: Social Media Integration for Artist Activity
priority: medium
status: proposed
category: feature
labels:
  - social-media
  - artist-info
  - content
  - real-time
  - feeds

description: |
  Integrate with social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Mastodon, Twitter/X)
  to display real-time artist activity, posts, and updates within the app. This keeps
  content fresh, increases engagement, and positions the app as a comprehensive source
  for artist information beyond just music.

problem: |
  Users want to stay updated on artist activity without leaving the app or checking
  multiple social platforms. Currently, there's no way to see what artists are up to
  beyond their music releases.

  Artist pages feel static without social content. Users want:
  - Recent posts and photos
  - Tour announcements
  - Behind-the-scenes content
  - Artist interactions with fans
  - All in one place, integrated with music info

solution: |
  Build social media integration system that:
  1. Fetches recent posts from artist social accounts
  2. Displays posts in a unified feed on artist pages
  3. Links to original posts for engagement
  4. Filters relevant content (music-related)
  5. Respects user privacy (no tracking by social platforms)
  6. Updates content regularly (every 30-60 minutes)
  7. Provides notifications for followed artists' posts

technical_requirements:
  backend:
    - Integrate Instagram Graph API (business/creator accounts)
    - Integrate Facebook Graph API
    - Integrate Mastodon API (open, no auth required for public posts)
    - Consider Twitter/X API (expensive, may skip initially)
    - Create social media post aggregation service
    - Implement content filtering (music-related only)
    - Add content moderation (NSFW filter, spam detection)
    - Build post caching system (reduce API calls)
    - Create API endpoints:
      - GET /artists/{id}/social-feed
      - GET /artists/{id}/social-posts/{platform}
      - POST /artists/{id}/follow (for notifications)
      - GET /me/social-feed (followed artists)

  social_platforms:

        - Good for indie/underground artists

    twitter_x:
      api: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs
      oauth: Required, expensive ($100-$5000/month)
      rate_limits: Varies by tier
      content: Tweets, media, engagement
      notes: |
        - API v2 is expensive
        - May skip initially due to cost
        - Consider alternative: RSS feed scraping (violates ToS)
        - Re-evaluate if pricing changes

  frontend:
    - Design social feed widget for artist pages
    - Implement infinite scroll for posts
    - Display media (images/videos) in lightbox
    - Show post engagement metrics
    - Add "View on [Platform]" links
    - Filter by platform (toggle IG/FB/Mastodon)
    - Show post timestamps ("2 hours ago")
    - Display artist profile pictures
    - Add post sharing functionality

  database:
    - Add SocialAccount table (artist_id, platform, account_id, username, url, verified)
    - Add SocialPost table (social_account_id, post_id, content, media_url, posted_at, likes, comments)
    - Add SocialPostMedia table (post_id, media_type, url, thumbnail_url)
    - Add UserArtistFollow table (user_id, artist_id, notify_on_posts)
    - Add SocialFeedCache table (cache key, data, expires_at)
    - Index on artist_id and posted_at for fast queries

  content_moderation:
    - NSFW content filtering (use AI/ML service like Google Cloud Vision)
    - Spam detection (repetitive content, excessive links)
    - Profanity filter (optional, user preference)
    - Copyright detection (reposted content)
    - Reported content handling

  privacy_considerations:
    - No social platform tracking pixels
    - Proxy all media through own CDN
    - Don't send user data to social platforms
    - Clear disclosure of what data is displayed
    - User opt-out of social content

dependencies:
  - Rich artist information system (artist pages)
  - Background worker for content fetching
  - CDN for media proxy
  - Content moderation service

acceptance_criteria:
  - Artist pages display recent social posts (last 30 days)
  - Posts update every 30-60 minutes
  - Media displays correctly (images, videos)
  - Users can click through to original posts
  - Content is appropriately filtered/moderated
  - Performance impact is minimal (< 500ms page load)
  - No user tracking by social platforms
  - Notifications work for followed artists
  - System handles rate limits gracefully

estimated_effort: 5-6 weeks
risks:
  - API rate limits (may not be able to serve many users)
  - API costs (especially Twitter/X)
  - Content moderation complexity
  - Artist account discovery (matching artists to social accounts)
  - Platform API changes
  - Privacy compliance (GDPR, etc.)
  - Some artists don't use social media

monetization_impact: |
  Indirect revenue impact:
  - Increased session time (users browse social content)
  - Higher engagement = more ad impressions
  - Stickiness (users rely on app for all artist info)
  - Viral potential (users share artist posts from app)
  - Data on artist activity helps affiliate recommendations

notes: |
  - Start with Instagram and Facebook (most artists use these)
  - Add Mastodon (open API, growing adoption)
  - Skip Twitter initially (expensive API)
  - Consider YouTube integration (artist channels, music videos)
  - Implement artist account verification system (confirm it's the real artist)
  - Build "Artist Account Matching" service (automatically find social accounts)
  - Allow artists to verify/claim their accounts
  - Add "Artist Verified" badge
  - Consider user-submitted social account suggestions
  - Phase 1: Instagram integration
  - Phase 2: Facebook integration
  - Phase 3: Mastodon integration
  - Phase 4: Content filtering and moderation
  - Phase 5: Notifications and followed artists feed
  - Add "trending artists" based on social activity
  - Show artist milestones (1M followers reached, etc.)
