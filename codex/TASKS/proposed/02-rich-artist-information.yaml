description: |
  Create a comprehensive artist information system that aggregates data from multiple
  sources to provide extensive biographies, discographies, and contextual information
  far exceeding what streaming services offer. This positions the app as an educational
  and informational resource, not just a playlist manager.

problem: |
  Streaming services provide minimal artist information (short bio, top tracks).
  Users want deeper context about artists including:
  - Comprehensive biography with historical context
  - Connections to music movements/scenes/labels
  - Full discography with album details
  - Related artists with explained relationships
  - Social media and web presence
  - Current activity and news

solution: |
  Build a rich artist information system that:
  1. Aggregates data from Wikipedia, MusicBrainz, Last.fm, and streaming APIs
  2. Stores comprehensive artist profiles with relationships
  3. Provides hyperlinked navigation (artist → label → scene → related artists)
  4. Allows artist contributions and edits (with moderation)
  5. Updates dynamically with artist activity and news
  6. Presents information in an engaging, educational format

technical_requirements:
  backend:
    - Integrate Wikipedia API for biographies
    - Integrate MusicBrainz API for discography and relationships
    - Integrate Last.fm API for tags, similar artists, and statistics
    - Create comprehensive Artist schema with all metadata
    - Add Label, MusicGenre, Scene, and Movement entities
    - Implement artist enrichment background jobs
    - Create API endpoints for artist info (GET /artists/{id}/biography, /artists/{id}/discography)
    - Build content moderation system for artist contributions
    - Add versioning/history for artist edits

  database:
    - Extend Artist table (biography, formed_date, disbanded_date, origin, etc.)
    - Add ArtistBiography table (long-form content with sections)
    - Add Label table (name, description, founded, website)
    - Add Scene table (name, description, time_period, location)
    - Add Movement table (name, description, time_period, characteristics)
    - Add ArtistRelationship table (artist_id, related_artist_id, relationship_type, description)
    - Add ArtistContribution table (artist_id, user_id, content, status, moderation)
    - Add ArtistSocialMedia table (artist_id, platform, url, follower_count)
    - Add ArtistNews table (artist_id, title, url, published_date, source)

  frontend:
    - Design comprehensive artist profile page
    - Implement biography display with hyperlinked entities
    - Create discography browser with album details
    - Build related artists graph/network view
    - Add social media feed widget
    - Display recent news and activity
    - Add artist contribution form for verified artists/users
    - Implement search within artist content

  apis_to_integrate:
    - Wikipedia API (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API)
    - MusicBrainz API (https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API)
    - Last.fm API (https://www.last.fm/api)
    - Bandsintown API (for tour dates)
    - RSS feeds from artist websites/blogs
    - Social media APIs (Instagram, Facebook, Mastodon)

dependencies:
  - Existing Artist entity and metadata
  - Worker system for background enrichment
  - Content moderation system (needs to be built)

acceptance_criteria:
  - Artist pages display comprehensive biography with sources cited
  - All mentioned artists, labels, scenes, movements are hyperlinked
  - Users can navigate through related artists easily
  - Artist discography is complete and accurate
  - Social media activity displays when available
  - Verified artists can request edits to their profiles
  - Content updates automatically from sources every 24-48 hours
  - Biography is at least 5x more detailed than Spotify bio

estimated_effort: 6-8 weeks
risks:
  - Wikipedia content quality varies by artist
  - API rate limits from multiple services
  - Maintaining data accuracy across sources
  - Content moderation workload for contributions
  - Copyright concerns with biography text

monetization_impact: |
  Rich content increases session time dramatically:
  - Users spend more time exploring artists
  - Higher engagement = more ad revenue
  - Affiliate opportunities (vinyl, concert tickets, merch)
  - Position as educational resource attracts grants/partnerships

notes: |
  - Consider using GPT-4 to synthesize biographies from multiple sources
  - Implement citation system for academic credibility
  - Add "deep dive" mode with even more detail for enthusiasts
  - Consider partnerships with music historians/journalists
  - Build API for other apps to access this data (monetization opportunity)
  - Phase 1: Biography and basic info
  - Phase 2: Full discography and relationships
  - Phase 3: Artist contributions and moderation
  - Phase 4: Social media and news integration
