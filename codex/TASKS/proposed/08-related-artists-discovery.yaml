title: Related Artists Discovery and Recommendation System
priority: high
status: proposed

  - discovery

description: |
  Build a comprehensive related artists discovery system that goes beyond simple
  "similar artists" to show nuanced relationships, influences, collaborations, and
  sonic similarities. This becomes a powerful music discovery tool and keeps users
  engaged exploring new artists.

problem: |
  Streaming services show basic "similar artists" but don't explain WHY artists are
  related or show the depth of connections in the music world. Users want:
  - Deeper understanding of artist relationships
  - Discovery of artists they might not find otherwise
  - Explanation of WHY artists are related
  - Visual representation of artist networks
  - Multiple ways to discover (genre, mood, influence, collaboration, etc.)

solution: |
  Build a multi-faceted related artists system that:
  1. Aggregates relationships from multiple sources (Last.fm, Spotify, MusicBrainz)
  2. Explains relationship types (influence, similar sound, collaboration, same label, etc.)
  3. Calculates relationship strength scores
  4. Visualizes artist networks as interactive graphs
  5. Enables "deep discovery" by traversing artist connections
  6. Learns from user behavior to personalize recommendations
  7. Shows historical influences and contemporary peers

technical_requirements:
  backend:
    - Integrate Last.fm API for similar artists
    - Integrate Spotify API for related artists
    - Integrate MusicBrainz for collaborations and labels
    - Build relationship scoring algorithm
    - Create artist similarity calculation service
    - Implement collaborative filtering based on user listening
    - Add graph database for artist networks (Neo4j or similar)
    - Create API endpoints:
      - GET /artists/{id}/related
      - GET /artists/{id}/similar
      - GET /artists/{id}/influences
      - GET /artists/{id}/influenced-by
      - GET /artists/{id}/collaborators
      - GET /artists/{id}/network (graph data)
      - GET /artists/{id}/recommended-for-user

  relationship_types:
    similar_sound:
      description: Artists that sound alike
      sources: [Last.fm, Spotify, audio analysis]
      weight: high

    influence:
      description: Artist A influenced Artist B
      sources: [MusicBrainz, Wikipedia, artist statements]
      weight: high
      directional: true

    collaboration:
      description: Artists who worked together
      sources: [MusicBrainz, album credits]
      weight: medium

    same_genre:
      description: Artists in same genre/subgenre
      sources: [Last.fm tags, MusicBrainz genres]
      weight: low

    same_label:
      description: Artists on same record label
      sources: [MusicBrainz, Discogs]
      weight: low

    same_scene:
      description: Part of same music scene/movement
      sources: [Wikipedia, editorial data]
      weight: medium

    covered_by:
      description: Artist B covered Artist A's song
      sources: [MusicBrainz, SecondHandSongs.com]
      weight: low

  data_sources:
    lastfm:
      endpoint: artist.getSimilar
      notes: Good general similarity data
      rate_limit: 5 calls/second

    spotify:
      endpoint: GET /artists/{id}/related-artists
      notes: Algorithm-based, limited to 20 artists
      rate_limit: Varies

    musicbrainz:
      endpoint: Multiple (relationships, recordings, labels)
      notes: Rich metadata, collaboration data
      rate_limit: 1 call/second (be respectful)

    everynoise:
      url: everynoise.com
      notes: Genre map with similarity distances
      access: Scraping or partnership

  recommendation_algorithm:
    inputs:
      - User listening history
      - User playlist patterns
      - Explicit preferences (likes/dislikes)
      - Similar user behaviors (collaborative filtering)
      - Artist metadata and relationships
      - Audio features (tempo, key, energy, etc.)

    scoring:
      - Relationship strength (0-1.0)
      - User preference alignment (0-1.0)
      - Popularity penalty (avoid only showing popular artists)
      - Diversity bonus (encourage discovery outside comfort zone)
      - Recency weight (prefer recently active artists)

    personalization:
      - Learn from user clicks on recommendations
      - Track which relationship types user explores
      - Adjust algorithm weights per user
      - A/B test different algorithms

  frontend:
    - Design related artists section on artist pages
    - Show relationship type and strength
    - Display explanation text ("Similar because...")
    - Implement artist network graph visualization (D3.js or similar)
    - Add filters (similar sound, influences, collaborators, etc.)
    - Show "Deep discovery" mode (traverse multiple degrees)
    - Highlight artists user hasn't heard yet
    - Add "Discover from [Artist]" dedicated page
    - Show artist thumbnails and key info
    - Enable quick play preview or playlist creation

  database:
    - Add ArtistRelationship table (artist_id, related_artist_id, relationship_type, strength, source)
    - Add RelationshipType enum (similar_sound, influence, collaboration, etc.)
    - Add UserArtistInteraction table (user_id, artist_id, interaction_type, timestamp)
    - Add RecommendationLog table (user_id, artist_id, recommended_at, clicked)
    - Add ArtistFeatures table (artist_id, audio_features, genre_vector)
    - Index on artist_id and strength for fast queries
    - Consider graph database (Neo4j) for network queries

  machine_learning:
    - Audio feature extraction (use Spotify API or Essentia)
    - Clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN) for genre grouping
    - Collaborative filtering (user-based and item-based)
    - Matrix factorization for latent features
    - Neural network for complex relationship prediction
    - Regular model retraining with new data

dependencies:
  - Rich artist information system
  - User listening history tracking
  - Multiple provider integrations
  - Worker system for background processing

acceptance_criteria:
  - Related artists display on every artist page
  - At least 20 related artists per popular artist
  - Relationship types are clearly labeled
  - Relationship explanations are understandable
  - Network graph is performant (renders < 2 seconds)
  - Personalized recommendations improve with usage
  - "Deep discovery" finds non-obvious connections
  - System updates relationships weekly
  - Algorithm quality measured by click-through rate (> 10%)
  - User satisfaction survey rating > 4/5

estimated_effort: 6-8 weeks
risks:
  - Data quality varies by artist (obscure artists have less data)
  - Relationship calculation is computationally expensive
  - Graph queries can be slow at scale
  - Cold start problem (new users have no history)
  - Bias toward popular artists
  - API rate limits for data collection
  - Machine learning model accuracy

monetization_impact: |
  High engagement feature:
  - Users spend 20-30% more time exploring artists
  - Increased music discovery = more playlist building
  - More active users = higher ad revenue
  - Affiliate opportunities (discover → buy vinyl)
  - Premium feature potential (unlimited deep discovery)
  - Data insights valuable for labels/artists (could sell)

notes: |
  - Start with simple similar artists (Last.fm + Spotify)
  - Add relationship types incrementally
  - Build graph visualization last (most complex)
  - Consider partnerships with music intelligence companies
  - Implement feedback mechanism ("Is this helpful?")
  - Add "Surprise me" feature (random deep discovery)
  - Show artist "family trees" (influences through time)
  - Create "Six Degrees of [Artist]" game
  - Generate playlist from artist network path
  - Phase 1: Basic similar artists from Last.fm/Spotify
  - Phase 2: Relationship types and explanations
  - Phase 3: Personalization and ML
  - Phase 4: Graph visualization
  - Phase 5: Deep discovery and advanced features
  - Consider "Discover Weekly" style curated playlist based on this data
  - Add "Artist DNA" feature showing genre composition
  - Show "Artist Timeline" of influences over their career
