priority: high
status: proposed
category: frontend
labels:
  - web-ui
  - react
  - user-experience
  - mvp

description: |
  Build a complete web application that provides an intuitive interface for all
  playlist management features. Currently, apps/web is a stub. This needs to become
  a full-featured SPA that makes the app accessible to non-technical users and
  provides the foundation for all future UI features.

problem: |
  The project currently has:
  - Mobile app (React Native/Expo) with basic functionality
  - API server with most endpoints implemented
  - apps/web is just a placeholder/stub

  Users need a web interface to:
  - Manage playlists without installing mobile app
  - Export/import playlists easily
  - View rich artist information
  - Discover new music
  - Use on desktop computers

solution: |
  Build a modern, responsive web application using:
  - React 18+ with TypeScript
  - Vite for build tooling
  - TanStack Query for API state management
  - TailwindCSS for styling
  - Radix UI or shadcn/ui for components
  - React Router for navigation
  - Recharts for visualizations

  Pages and features:
  1. Landing page with value proposition
  2. OAuth login/signup flow
  3. Dashboard with overview stats
  4. Playlists library with search/filter
  5. Playlist detail with track list
  6. Artist pages with rich information
  7. Export/import wizards
  8. Settings and preferences
  9. Now playing widget (if applicable)

monetization_impact: |
  Critical for growth:
  - Lowers barrier to entry (no app install required)
  - Better for desktop users (primary use case)
  - SEO brings organic traffic
  - Easier to add ads to web than mobile
  - Premium features more discoverable
  - Web is easier to iterate on than mobile
  - Can run A/B tests easily

notes: |
  - Consider using a design system (Material, Ant Design) for faster dev
  - Or build custom with TailwindCSS + Radix UI for uniqueness
  - Implement progressive enhancement (works without JS)
  - Add PWA features (install to home screen, offline support)
  - Consider SSR with Next.js for better SEO (tradeoff: complexity)
  - Current Vite setup is simpler and good enough for SPA
  - Phase 1: Core pages (dashboard, playlists, export)
  - Phase 2: Rich pages (artist, album, now playing)
  - Phase 3: Advanced features (import, recommendations)
  - Phase 4: Polish (animations, micro-interactions, SEO)
  - Use Storybook for component development
  - Write unit tests for components (React Testing Library)
  - E2E tests with Playwright or Cypress
  - Analytics with Plausible or Google Analytics
  - Error tracking with Sentry
