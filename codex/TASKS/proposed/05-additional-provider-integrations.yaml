title: Additional Streaming Service Provider Integrations
priority: medium
status: proposed
category: integration
labels:
  - providers
  - oauth
  - api-integration
  - streaming-services

description: |
  Expand platform support by integrating additional major streaming services:
  Amazon Music, Pandora, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Qobuz, and Apple Music.
  This increases market reach and makes the app truly universal for playlist
  management across all major services.

problem: |
  Currently only Spotify is fully implemented, with partial support for Deezer,
  Tidal, and YouTube Music. Users on other platforms cannot use the app.

  To achieve market dominance as a free TuneMyMusic alternative, the app must
  support ALL major streaming services.

solution: |
  Implement full OAuth and API integration for each additional provider:
  1. Amazon Music - Major platform, especially for Prime subscribers
  2. Pandora - Popular in US, different model (stations vs playlists)
  3. SoundCloud - Essential for independent artists and DJ mixes
  4. Bandcamp - Critical for indie/underground music community
  5. Qobuz - High-end audiophile platform
  6. Apple Music - Massive user base, but limited API

technical_requirements:
  per_provider:
    - Implement OAuth 2.0 flow (or API key auth where applicable)
    - Create provider client package (@app/providers-{name})
    - Implement API methods:
      - getUserProfile()
      - getUserPlaylists()
      - getPlaylistTracks()
      - createPlaylist()
      - addTracksToPlaylist()
      - removeTracksFromPlaylist()
      - searchTracks()
      - getNowPlaying() (if available)
    - Add token refresh logic
    - Implement rate limiting and error handling
    - Add provider-specific enrichment for tracks/albums
    - Update database schema for provider-specific IDs
    - Add integration tests

  amazon_music:
    api: https://developer.amazon.com/docs/music/API_web_playlist.html
    oauth: Amazon OAuth 2.0
    notes: |
      - Requires Amazon developer account
      - Different API for web vs mobile
      - Limited to Prime/Unlimited subscribers
      - Good documentation but restrictive policies

  pandora:
    api: https://developer.pandora.com/docs/key-concepts/apis/
    oauth: Pandora OAuth 2.0
    notes: |
      - Station-based model different from playlists
      - May need to map stations to playlists concept
      - Limited track-level control (thumbs up/down)
      - API access requires approval
    unique_features:
      - Station creation from seed tracks/artists
      - Thumbs up/down feedback system
      - Music Genome Project tags

  soundcloud:
    api: https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide
    oauth: OAuth 2.0
    notes: |
      - Large indie/underground catalog
      - User-uploaded content (need moderation)
      - Some tracks are "downloadable"
      - API has been somewhat limited in recent years
    unique_features:
      - Reposts and likes (not just playlists)
      - Comments with timestamps
      - Downloadable tracks

  bandcamp:
    api: https://bandcamp.com/developer
    oauth: Limited - mostly fan/collection access
    notes: |
      - No official public API currently
      - May need to work directly with Bandcamp for access
      - Strong focus on purchases, not streaming
      - Collection is "owned" tracks, not playlists
    unique_features:
      - Purchase integration
      - Direct artist support
      - Download access for owned tracks

  qobuz:
    api: Contact api@qobuz.com (per notes)
    oauth: To be determined
    notes: |
      - High-resolution audio (24-bit/192kHz)
      - Audiophile-focused
      - Smaller user base but highly engaged
      - May have partnership opportunities
    unique_features:
      - Hi-res audio quality metadata
      - Editorial playlists
      - Album purchase options

  apple_music:
    api: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/
    oauth: Apple Sign In + MusicKit
    notes: |
      - Massive user base (100M+ subscribers)
      - API requires Apple Developer account ($99/year)
      - MusicKit JS for web, native APIs for iOS
      - Limited compared to Spotify API
      - Requires user to have active Apple Music subscription
    unique_features:
      - Deep iOS integration
      - Siri integration potential
      - iCloud library sync

  backend_infrastructure:
    - Add provider configuration to env vars
    - Update OAuth callback routes for new providers
    - Add provider-specific error handling
    - Implement provider capability matrix (what each supports)
    - Add provider feature flags for gradual rollout
    - Create provider abstraction layer for common operations

  frontend:
    - Add provider logos and branding
    - Update OAuth connection flow for each provider
    - Add provider-specific UI elements (station support for Pandora, etc.)
    - Show which features are available per provider
    - Add provider status indicator (connected, disconnected, limited)

  database:
    - Extend Account table with provider-specific fields
    - Add ProviderCapability table (feature support matrix)
    - Add ProviderMetadata table (extra data per provider)

dependencies:
  - Existing OAuth infrastructure
  - Provider abstraction in @app/providers-core
  - Token encryption system
  - Worker system for background sync

acceptance_criteria:
  per_provider:
    - OAuth connection flow works end-to-end
    - Can fetch user playlists and tracks
    - Can create and edit playlists
    - Token refresh works automatically
    - Error states are handled gracefully
    - Integration tests pass with >80% coverage
    - Documentation exists for provider-specific quirks
    - Rate limits are respected

estimated_effort: 8-12 weeks (1-2 weeks per provider)
priority_order:
  1. Apple Music (largest user base)
  2. Amazon Music (Prime subscribers)
  3. SoundCloud (unique content)
  4. Qobuz (partnership potential)
  5. Pandora (different model, complex)
  6. Bandcamp (limited API, may not be feasible initially)

risks:
  - API access approval (some require application review)
  - API limitations (some providers have restricted APIs)
  - Costs (Apple Developer account, potential API usage fees)
  - Maintenance burden (more APIs to keep updated)
  - Provider API changes breaking integrations
  - Different capabilities make feature parity impossible

monetization_impact: |
  Each provider integration expands addressable market:
  - Apple Music: +100M potential users
  - Amazon Music: +75M potential users
  - Pandora: +50M potential users
  - SoundCloud: +175M potential users
  - More users = more ad revenue and affiliate opportunities

notes: |
  - Start with providers that have best APIs and largest user bases
  - Consider phased rollout (private beta per provider)
  - Document provider comparison matrix for users
  - Some providers may require business partnerships
  - Consider revenue share deals with smaller providers
  - Bandcamp might be better as "view only" integration initially
  - Apple Music iOS integration is easiest, web is more complex
  - SoundCloud has different content model (more like YouTube)
  - Consider integrating Last.fm as a listening history provider (not streaming)
