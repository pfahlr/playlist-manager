title: Server-Sent Events for job progress at /jobs/{id}/events
branch: codex/07d_sse_job_progress
overview: >
  Stream migration/export progress via SSE so web/mobile can show live updates. Keep /jobs/{id} polling as fallback.
acceptance:
  - GET /jobs/{id}/events streams event:progress data:{"percent":...}
  - worker emits progress updates through a channel; tests simulate job lifecycle
artifacts_to_touch:
  - apps/api/src/routes/jobs.events.ts
  - apps/worker/src/lib/progress.ts
  - apps/api/src/dev/start.ts (register SSE route)
steps:
  - Add minimal bus (Redis pub/sub or in-proc for dev)
  - Emit progress at safe cadence; close stream on completion
