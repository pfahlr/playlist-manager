title: Prisma seed data (minimal fixtures for contracts & demos)
branch: codex/02c_prisma_seeds
overview: >
  Create deterministic seed data (1 test user, 2 artists with MBIDs, 2 albums,
  1 playlist with 6 items) to enable local runs & contract tests without providers.
acceptance:
  - pnpm -F @app/db prisma db seed exits 0 and re-seeding is idempotent
  - db:health returns "ok"
  - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM playlist_items returns >= 6 after seeding
  - Seeds are deterministic (same IDs on re-run)
artifacts_to_touch:
  - packages/db/package.json
  - prisma/seed.ts
  - prisma/seed-data/*.json
  - README.md (brief "Seeding" section)
steps:
  - Add "prisma": { "seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts" } to packages/db/package.json
  - Implement seed.ts: upsert user, artists (with mbid), albums, recordings, playlist(+items)
  - Ensure transactions & ordering; wrap in try/catch with process.exit codes
  - Document: pnpm -F @app/db prisma db seed
