title: Offline fixture harness for provider tests (record/replay)
branch: codex/06h_provider_fixture_harness
overview: >
  Add a record/replay harness (nock or fetch-mock with saved JSON) so provider tests run without network.
  Switch via PROVIDER_FIXTURES=1.
acceptance:
  - provider tests pass offline using stored fixtures
  - a script updates fixtures deterministically
artifacts_to_touch:
  - packages/providers/core/test/fixtures/*.json
  - packages/providers/core/test/fixtureHarness.ts
  - package.json scripts ("test:update-fixtures")
steps:
  - Wrap fetch; when recording, save responses; when replaying, serve from disk
