id: 01a_spec_bootstrap
title: Seed API spec checks & client types
branch: codex/01a_spec_bootstrap
overview: >
  Ensure OpenAPI 3.1 is linted, typegen works, and breaking changes are checked.
acceptance:
  - Running `pnpm lint:api` exits 0.
  - Running `pnpm gen:types` regenerates packages/contracts/src/api.types.ts with no diff.
  - A failing diff is produced if openapi.yaml is modified incompatibly (documented via README note).
artifacts_to_touch:
  - openapi.yaml
  - packages/contracts/src/api.types.ts
  - README.md
constraints:
  - Do not change route shapes yet; this task only validates the current spec and typegen.
steps:
  - Add/verify Redocly config if needed; ensure `gen:types` produces a file.
  - Add a short README “Spec Workflow” section with the 3 commands and expected outcomes.
