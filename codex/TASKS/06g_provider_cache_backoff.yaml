title: Provider HTTP client with retry/backoff/circuit-breaker + response caching
branch: codex/06g_provider_cache_backoff
overview: >
  A shared client wrapper for providers: exponential backoff with jitter, 429/5xx handling, token-refresh hooks,
  LRU/Redis cache with TTL for read endpoints, and a circuit breaker.
acceptance:
  - retries on 429 with backoff; respects Retry-After when present
  - caching reduces duplicate calls in tests; breaker opens after threshold
artifacts_to_touch:
  - packages/providers/core/src/http/client.ts
  - packages/providers/core/src/http/cache.ts
  - packages/providers/core/test/client.test.ts
steps:
  - Implement policy; add metrics hooks; unit tests with fake timers
