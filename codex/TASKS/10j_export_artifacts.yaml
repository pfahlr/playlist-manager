title: Export artifact storage (S3/MinIO) + presigned URLs
branch: codex/10j_export_artifacts
overview: >
  Persist generated exports to S3/MinIO; store object key in DB; /jobs/{id} returns artifact_url
  via presigned URL when succeeded.
acceptance:
  - After POST /exports/file, /jobs/{id} yields artifact_url once succeeded
  - Local dev uses MinIO docker with credentials from env
artifacts_to_touch:
  - apps/worker/src/exports/file.ts
  - apps/api/src/lib/storage/s3.ts
  - docker-compose.yml (MinIO service, if not present)
steps:
  - Add S3 client; putObject; createPresignedUrl; wire into job completion path.
